# Titanic-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns based on features such as gender, age, passenger class, family size, and fare.  

## 🗂️ Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset  

## 🔍 Analysis Performed  
- Missing value treatment (mean/mode imputation)  
- Distribution of Age, Fare, and Family size  
- Survival analysis by **gender, class, family size, and embarkation port**  
- Grouped statistics and percentage survival rates  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraies  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Women had a higher survival chance compared to men  
- Passengers in **1st class** had better survival rates than 3rd class  
- Very large families had lower survival chances compared to small families
